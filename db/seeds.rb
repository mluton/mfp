  {title: "What is Minecraft?", category_id: 1, description: "An overview describing the basic gameplay in Minecraft and the various game modes available.", body: "Minecraft is a sandbox game where the player makes creations from large blocks. A sandbox game is one in which there is no specific goal to be achieved. There is no princesses to rescue. There are no levels to complete.  There are no aliens to be defeated. In Minecraft, the player simply builds whatever creations they feel like building. Some people build fancy houses. Some people build elaborate underground catacombs. Some people recreate locations from popular movies. In addition to structures, players can also build machines. Machines can be as simple as a lever or as complex as a computer. Some people have built working clocks, light switches and mini-games just to name a few.\r\n\r\nThe game has a very low-resolution look to it which is part of the basis for its appeal. Minecraft is intentionally very pixelated. Some adults can be put off by the blocky art style but most kids don't mind at all.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played in a few different modes which can make it easier or more difficult depending on which one you choose.\r\n\r\n### Creative\r\n\r\nThe player has access to an infinite amount of building materials. Enemy monsters and creatures do not exist. You can fly and breathe underwater. You can fall from high places and not get hurt. This is the safest and easiest way for newcomers to play. Kids can build anything they want without fear of being attacked by monsters or dying in any way. The only exception is that in Creative mode it is possible to dig through the bottom of the world and fall through and die.\r\n\r\n### Survival\r\n\r\nThe player must gather building materials from the world by \"mining\" them. At nighttime enemy monsters appear and attack you. You can drown if you spend too much time underwater and you can get hurt by falling from a high place. Survival mode is for more experienced players who know how to protect themselves from the dangers present in this mode.\r\n\r\n### Hardcore\r\n\r\nThis is the same as Survival mode with the addition that you only have one life. When you die the world is deleted and you will not be able to play that world again. Obviously, we do not recommend this game mode for kids. Only really experienced players who can handle the harsh consequences of dying should consider playing in Hardcore mode.\r\n", ordinal: 1, slug: "what-is-minecraft"},

Experienced players tend to scoff at the limitations of the Pocket Edition but it's a great low-cost introduction to Minecraft that doesn't involve the complexities of the computer version.\r\n\r\n### Xbox and Playstation\r\n\r\nThe Xbox and Playstation version of Minecraft is very similar to the PC version with a few differences like the inclusion of tutorials, a simpler crafting system and a split-screen mode for multiple players.

You simply navigate the online store for each respective device and purchase Minecraft the same as you do any other app or game. You can also use regular web links for each of these stores as well.\r\n\r\n* [Xbox 360](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Minecraft-Xbox-360-Edition/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802584111f7)\r\n* [Playstation 3](https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/games/minecraft-playstation3-edition/cid=UP4433-NPUB31419_00-TRIALUPGRADE0001)\r\n* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id479516143)\r\n* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe)\r\n\r\n### Windows and Mac\r\n\r\nPurchasing Minecraft for a desktop computer is where things get a little more involved. Open a web browser and navigate to [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net). Select the big \"Get Minecraft\" button near the top of the page.\r\n\r\n### The Mojang Account\r\nYou'll need to create a Mojang account before buying Minecraft. Mojang is the company responsible for Minecraft. Creating a Mojang accounts allows them to keep track of what you've bought from them so you can re-download things at a later date. If you're familiar with Blizzard games like World of Warcraft, the Mojang account is roughly equivalent to a Battle.net account.\r\n\r\nThis account will be used to log in to Minecraft every time your child wants to play so the account should be specific to them and should not use a password you don't want your child to know. The email address used for your child's Mojang account will need to be verified so it needs to be a real email address. A fake email address won't work here. If you're uncomfortable with your child having their own email address you can use a Gmail trick to give a unique email address for the Mojang account and still have all the email go to your Gmail account. This assumes you, the parent, have a Gmail address. For example, say your Gmail address is `frank@gmail.com` and your daughter's name is Agnes. You can use `frank+agnes@gmail.com` for your daughter's Mojang account. Gmail will ignore everything from the `+` onwards so any mail sent to `frank+agnes@gmail.com` goes to `frank@gmail.com`. She gets an email address to use for Minecraft but all the email still goes to you.\r\n\r\nAfter registering you'll be asked to validate your email address. You need to do this before proceeding further.\r\nAfter verifying your email address you should be redirected to a page where you can create your Minecraft name and enter payment details.\r\n\r\nThe Minecraft name is different from your Mojang account email address. This is the name your child will go by in the game. This name must be unique for all players of Minecraft so naturally all of the obvious and desirable names have already been taken. You'll have to get really creative. For privacy reasons we encourage kids to **NOT** use their real names anywhere in their Minecraft name.\r\n\r\nWhen you entered your Minecraft name and payment details click the giant green Purchase button. From there you should be taken to a page where you can download the Minecraft game. Go ahead and select the download link to download Minecraft. You can always re-download Minecraft by going to [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net) and logging in with your Mojang account. If you've bought the game you should see a 'Download' button near the top of the page instead of the 'Get Minecraft' button. You'll also receive an email from Mojang with download links.\r\n\r\n### Installation — Mac OS X\r\n\r\nDouble-click the `minecraft.dmg` file which you previously downloaded. This will create the Minecraft install disk image on your desktop. Double-click the Minecraft installer disk image.\r\n\r\nIn the next window that appears you'll see two icons. One for Minecraft and the other is a shortcut to your Applications folder. Simply click and drag the Minecraft icon to the Applications folder and let go. The Minecraft application should now be copied to your Applications folder.\r\n\r\n[short animated gif]\r\n\r\nTo run Minecraft you can do any of the following...\r\n\r\nActivate Spotlight by pressing ⌘-SPACE and type `minecraft` into the search box. Click Minecraft when it shows up. \r\n\r\n[short animated gif]\r\n\r\nActivate Launch Center and find Minecraft in the grid of icons. If you're having trouble finding it you can simply type 'minecraft' while the Launch Center screen is active and the list should be filtered to just Minecraft.\r\n\r\n[short animated gif]\r\n\r\nOpen Finder, select the Applications folder and double-click Minecraft.\r\n\r\n[short animated gif]\r\n\r\n### Installation — Windows\r\n\r\n_fill in this area_", ordinal: 5, slug: "how-do-i-buy-minecraft"},

This is where you login with your Mojang account credentials.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/launcher.02.launcher-login.png)\r\n\r\nWhy does Minecraft need a launcher like this? When you're just starting out with the single-player game it does seem like overkill. However, when you start to get into multiplayer it'll become necessary to run particular versions of the game. Also, if you want to safely experiment with new beta releases or go back in time and play early versions of Minecraft you'll need to setup a profile.\r\n\r\nA profile is a group of settings you can set to run Minecraft with. The two settings you're most likely to change is \"Version\" and \"Profile Name\". The default profile is set to always use the most recent version which is perfect for your single-player adventures.\r\n\r\nIf you're playing a multiplayer game on a server you will probably need to create a profile for a slightly older version of the game. Most servers tends to lag behind a couple of versions. To set up a new profile select the \"New Profile\" button at the bottom of the launcher.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/launcher.03.launcher-new-profile-button.png)\r\n\r\nGive the profile a name. It can be anything that makes sense to you. A good name would be something that names the particular server this profile is for. Then you'll want to select the appropriate version from the \"Use version\" dropdown list. The person who runs the server should be able to tell you exactly which version to use. The profile window might look something like the following...\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/launcher.04.launcher-custom-profile.png)\r\n\r\nSelect \"Save Profile\" to save your new profile.

If this happens to you simply quit the Minecraft Launcher and restart it. You may need to login again.

  {title: "Downloading Minecraft Files Safely", category_id: 2, description: "Our guidelines for downloading files from some of the worst sites on the Internet.", body: "Despite the enormous popularity of Minecraft among kids Mojang has done very little to shepherd the online community surrounding its game. Most kids have resorted to free file hosting services for sharing their Minecraft related add-ons. These file hosting services also happen to be some of the scammiest sites you're likely to encounter on the internet. Seriously, Minecraft download sites are the absolute worst places on the internet. These sites are infested with an insane amount of scammy advertisements. Most are specifically designed to trick to mislead you into clicking things which have nothing to do with the file you actually want to download. At best, you'll end up clicking and getting a pile of ads instead of an actual file download. At worst, you'll end up with malware/spyware/adware installed on your computer instead. Finding the link to download the real Minecraft related file you want can be a painful exercise.\r\n\r\nIf you're uncomfortable with your kids ability to safely navigate sites like this then we strongly recommend a savvy adult do the actual hunting and downloading. If your kids don't know what they're doing it can be extremely easy for them to accidentally infect your computer with all kinds of exploitative software harmful to your computer. Most of the undesirable software targets Windows computers so you're a little safer using OS X but even that's not a guarantee you won't run into trouble.\r\n\r\nThe best advise we have is to navigate these download sites very deliberately and carefully. Look at everything with a critical eye.\r\n\r\nMany of these file hosting services claim they are supporting the creators by making you click through ads to get to an actual file. While we believe in supporting creative endeavors we're strongly opposed doing so through deceitful practices designed to prey on kids who don't stand a chance against these scams.\r\n\r\nIn particular, many downloads will be behind an AdFly link. After clicking on an AdFly link wait a few seconds for the actual download link to appear in the upper right corner. The entire rest of the page is bad news.\r\n\r\nIf your kids are technically savvy and have the knowledge and skills to navigate through these awful sites then that's great. Otherwise, we recommend parents do the actual downloading and teach your kids how to avoid the scams at the same time.", ordinal: 2, slug: "downloading-minecraft-files-safely"},

  {title: "All About Minecraft Seeds", category_id: 2, description: "In Minecraft you can share worlds are they are initially generated through a feature called seeds. We tell you all about them.", body: "When you create a new world in Minecraft the game creates a seemingly random landscape. It does have to adhere to certain conditions though. The world is divided into different biomes which are areas of land with specific geographical features. There are deserts, jungles, and hilly areas. Land can either be sloped or flat. Trees and flowers are placed in areas which make sense. Lakes, caves and villages are also placed throughout the world. Valuable minerals like coal, iron and gold are scattered throughout the world for you to discover and mine. When Minecraft creates a new world it creates a unique world in such a way that makes sense as a place to live in and explore.\r\n\r\nHow unique is each Minecraft world? Currently, Minecraft can generate about 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 unique worlds. That's 18 quintillion!\r\n\r\nWhen you tell Minecraft to create a new world it first generates a random number. This random number is called a \"seed\". Then Minecraft generates a world based on that seed. Different seeds result in a different worlds. More importantly, the same seed will always result in the same world. For example, if two different players each create a world with a seed of '42' then Minecraft will create an identical world for each player.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is only the case if the version of the game is the same also. Every time Minecraft is updated to a new version the world creation routine changes. For example, in Minecraft 1.7.5 the seed '42' will generate a given world. But in Minecraft 1.7.6 the seed '42' will generate a different world. If you're watching Minecraft tutorial videos on YouTube, the authors might post their seed along with a version number. This allows you to create the same world as the tutorial so you can follow along.\r\n\r\nHow exactly do you create a world with a specific seed? Normally, Minecraft chooses a random seem for you but you can also tell Minecraft exactly which seed to use.\r\n\r\nOn the Create New World screen there is a button labelled \"More World Options\". Click the \"More World Options\" button. \r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/seeds.01.createnewworld.png)\r\n\r\nNow you should see the options screen with a place to type in a seed right at the top.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/seeds.02.moreoptions.png)\r\n\r\nThe cool thing is you can type in both numbers and regular words. If you use words then Minecraft will first translate it to a number to use as the actual seed. Try typing in your own name as the seed and see kind of world gets generated.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do if you're playing a world and you want to know what seed was used to generate your world? Simply type the `seed` command. To enter a command while playing Minecraft first type `/` and then the command. In this case you would type `/seed`.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/seeds.03.command.png)\r\n\r\nThen press ENTER. The seed used to generate the world you're currently playing will be displayed. If it has a minus sign in front of it then it's a negative number. Minecraft seeds can be both positive and negative numbers.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/seeds.04.output.png)\r\n\r\nThere are online resources dedicated to cataloging interesting seeds. A couple of examples are [minecraft-seeds.net](http://minecraft-seeds.net) and [minecraftseeds.info](http://www.minecraftseeds.info).\r\n\r\nThere's also the popular [Minecraft Seeds Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/minecraft-seeds-pro/id528919633?mt=8]) app for iOS.

Naturally, for your kids this isn't good enough. A \"mod\" is a downloadable package that changes vanilla Minecraft is some way. Mods can be very ambitious by adding new blocks, creatures, items, user interface elements and other content to the game. Mods can also be more modest and may only add different settings or minor enhancements. If your child has been playing Minecraft for any length of time, chances are good they're going to ask you to install a mod.\r\n\r\nMods are not officially supported by Mojang. While some mods may be professionally written many more are the work of amateurs learning how to program. This is all well and good but you should be aware that mods may not always work on your system. Running multiple mods at the same time may cause problems as they may not be compatible with each other. You need to take special care to ensure the mods you're trying to install are compatible with the specific version of Minecraft you're running. Many mods require other mods in order to function so you'll need to make sure you find and download any dependent mods as needed.\r\n\r\nSome mods may cause your game to freeze and become unplayable. For these reasons we strongly recommend backuping your Minecraft folder before installing mods.\r\n\r\n## Backing Up Minecraft\r\n\r\nTo find your Minecraft folder open the launcher and click \"Edit Profile\". Then click \"Open Game Dir\" on the following dialog. Make a copy of everything in this folder.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.01.gamedir.png)\r\n\r\n## About Forge\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of installing mods. The old way and the [Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/) way. The old way involves opening .jar files and copying various things around and hoping it all works when you're done. Depending on your child's level of comfort with computers and the filesystem they may not be able to handle this on their own. You'll need to get involved and and will likely become frustrated when things don't go according to plan.\r\n\r\nThen there's the [Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/) way. Forge is itself a mod which make installing other mods easier. We here at Minecraft for Parents endorse Forge as it enables our kids to install their own mods with relative ease. It also works with both OS X and Windows. If your kids are too young to to install their own mods then you as a parent will appreciate the ease of using Forge when you need to do it for them. Some mods are written specifically for Forge so Forge is required for these mods anyway.\r\n\r\nMod Loader is mod manager similar to Forge but is only available for Windows.\r\n\r\n## Installing Forge\r\n\r\n[Download Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net). Look for the \"recommended\" line near the top of the page. Click the \"Installer\" link if you're using OS X. If you're using Windows click the \"Installer Win\" link.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.02.webpage.png)\r\n\r\nOpen the .jar (or .exe) file downloaded in the previous step. If you're using OS X you may see the following window when you do this.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.02.cantopen.png)\r\n\r\nIf you get this, then go to Security & Privacy within System Preferences. Make sure that \"Mac App Store and identified developers\" is selected. You may need to click the lock icon in the lower left corner and type your password to make this change. You may see text saying the Forge installer couldn't be opened with a button to open it anyway. If you see that then go ahead and click the \"Open Anyway\" button.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.03.securitypref.png)\r\n\r\nIf you don't see that then you'll need to navigate to your downloads folder, right-click (or CTRL-click) the forge installer and select \"Open\" from the pop-up menu.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.04.rightclickopen.png)\r\n\r\nYou should see a dialog like the following.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.05.unidentifiedopen.png)\r\n\r\nNow you can click \"Open\" and the Forge installer will start. When you see the following window make sure \"Install client\" is selected and click \"Okay\".\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.06.installer.png)\r\n\r\nWhen it's done, launch Minecraft. You'll notice a new profile has been created called 'Forge'. Select the Forge profile and click \"Play\".\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.08.profile.png)\r\n\r\nThere should be text in the lower left part of the main menu reading \"Minecraft Forge [version number]\" and \"3 mods loaded 3 mods active\".\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.09.mainmenu.png)\r\n\r\nThere's also a new \"Mods\" button on the main menu. These three mods don't do anything to your game but are necessary for other Forge mods to properly run.\r\n\r\n## Installing Forge Mods\r\n\r\nCompared to everything we've up until now, the process of installing an actual mod is relatively easy. We'll get you started with a simple mod install. We're going to download [Mo' Creatures](http://mocreatures.org/home) which adds a bunch of new animals to Minecraft. Go to the [Mo' Creatures Download](http://mocreatures.org/downloads) page and download it. Mo' Creatures also requires the Custom Mob Spawner mod so you'll need to download that one also. The link for it is on the same page.\r\n\r\nWhen you have the files downloaded open up your Minecraft game folder. Remember, to open your Minecraft folder start the launcher, edit your profile, and click \"Open Game Dir\". There should be a new \"mods\" folder inside your Minecraft folder.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.10.finder.png)\r\n\r\nCopy the files you downloaded into that folder. If you're using OS X it may have automatically unzipped them for you. That's okay, just copy the folders into the \"mods\" folder. Forge can work with both `.zip` files and folders.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.11.modsfolder.png)\r\n\r\nRelaunch Minecraft with the Forge profile selected. Create a new world. You should now see many new creatures roaming about that you haven't seen before.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/mods.12.screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nThese same steps should work for any other Forge compatible mods you'd like to install.\r\n", ordinal: 7, slug: "all-about-minecraft-mods"},

We help you navigate the multiplayer waters.", body: "After playing the single player game for a while your kids will start to wonder what that \"Multiplayer\" button on the main menu does.\r\n\r\nIt's only natural your kids will want to share the Minecraft experience and play with their friends. There are several ways this can be done in a safe manner.\r\n\r\n### [Local Area Network]()\r\nIt's fairly easy for multiple computers on the same network to play together in the same Minecraft world.\r\n\r\n### [Minecraft Realms]()\r\nThe easiest way to run a permanent 24/7 server is with Minecraft Realms. For $13/month you can easily create a server from within Minecraft itself. No special skills are required. Each server is invite-only so only players you invite will be able to play on your server.\r\n\r\n### [Public Servers or Playing With Strangers]()\r\nIt is possible to join other server random people have created. This is essentially playing with strangers.\r\n\r\n### Private Co-Located Server\r\nFor about $10 a month you can rent a proper server on the open internet to run a permanent 24/7 Minecraft server.

One person will start the game and everyone else will connect to it.\r\n\r\n### Starting the Game\r\n\r\nThe person who has been chosen to start the game will need to first start a **single player** game. This may seem a bit unintuitive, but trust us. It works out in the end. From the main menu click the \"Single Player\" button.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/lan.01.main-menu.png)\r\n\r\nSelect the desired map and then click the \"Play Selected World\" button.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/lan.02.single-player-menu.png)\r\n\r\n Once the game has loaded press ESC to bring up the Game Menu.

  {title: "Minecraft Multiplayer Over the Internet", category_id: 3, description: "Running a Minecraft server on the internet does require a special set of technical skills. There's a couple of options you can take if you feel comfortable dealing with network security and administering internet servers.", body: "While setting up games on your own network is fairly easy, playing with friends over the internet is a different matter. There are a couple of options, but they require a certain amount of tech savvy to setup and configure. Since both of these options pose potential security risks which must be carefully managed we can't recommend these for the average family. We'll describe them briefly here but won't go into detail. If you know what you're doing you probably already know how to configure a router and set up a server on the internet. The last option — Minecraft Realms — is what we recommend for normal people who want to host their own Minecraft server for friends and family.\r\n\r\n### Hole in the Firewall\r\n\r\nDepending on your router, it may be possible to configure it to allow incoming traffic from the outside world on a particular port. Traffic from this port would need to be forwarded to the specific computer on your network responsible for running the Minecraft server. This is like putting your home computer on the open internet just for a Minecraft dedicated server. (The \"Open To LAN\" option doesn't work for internet multiplayer.) Having a hole in your firewall just for Minecraft can be useful if you want to host ad-hoc games with close friends you know and trust. You'll need to give them your external IP address so they can connect to your game. Never use this technique to run a 24/7 server. Never give your IP address to anyone you don't personally know and trust.\r\n\r\n### Run Your Own Server\r\n\r\nIf you have the UNIX chops you can set up a 24/7 Minecraft server the old fashioned way. Find a good, inexpensive hosting service and run your own dedicated server there. Some popular virtual private hosting services include [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com), [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com), and [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). Pricing can vary between those services so make sure you choose a hosting provider appropriate for your budget and usage patterns. We recommend no less than 1GB of RAM for a dedicated server.\r\n\r\n### Minecraft Realms\r\n\r\nThe easiest and safest way to play with friends over the internet is with Minecraft Realms. It's a $13/month subscription, but it's well worth it. There are no security risks and no advanced skills required. See our [Minecraft Realms]() article for more details.", ordinal: 3, slug: "minecraft-multiplayer-over-the-internet"},
  {title: "Minecraft Realms", category_id: 3, description: "Learn the basics of Minecraft Realms where anyone can run their own server.", body: "Minecraft Realms is a service from Mojang that makes creating a 24/7 server for friends and family safe and easy. No technical knowledge is required at all. The servers are hosted and run by Mojang so you don't have to worry about firewalls or security. It **is** a paid service, but at $13/month it is well worth it for not  having to deal with the hassles of hosting a server on the internet yourself.\r\n\r\nThe official [Minecraft Realms](https://minecraft.net/realms) webpage has all the information you need. The Realms site is much better designed and usable than the main [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/realms) site which makes the need for an article like this less urgent. But we'll do one anyway. Here's the main bullet points about Realms.\r\n\r\n* You buy a subscription for $13/month which gives you the ability to create a 24/7 Minecraft server.\r\n\r\n* A credit card is required. Your subscription can be set to auto-renew each month or you can set it to expire after 1, 3, or 6 months without auto-renewing. It's almost a shame **not** to try it out for at least a month since you don't have to worry about coming back later to cancel it. Obviously, a parent will need to set this up. \r\n\r\n* You can invite up to 20 other players to your Realm. Up to 10 people can play simultaneously. These people don't have to pay anything. Only the host pays for the subscription. Of course, if you want to share the cost with your friends you can arrange for them to give you money periodically.\r\n\r\n* Since Realms are 24/7 servers the host does not have to be connected in order for other people to play on it. It's always there on the internet for any of your invited players to join.\r\n\r\nThose are the main points you as a parent probably care most about. For additional information we strongly recommend checking out the [Minecraft Realms FAQ](https://minecraft.net/realms/faq).\r\n\r\nTo purchase a subscription visit \tthe [Buy Realms Subscription](https://account.mojang.com/buy/realms) page. \r\n\r\n### Creating a Realm\r\n\r\nAssuming you've already purchased your Realms subscription, the first thing you'll need to do is click the Minecraft Realms button on the main menu.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.01.main-menu.png)\r\n\r\nThen click the \"Click to Create Realm!\" text on the next screen.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.02.realms-menu.png)\r\n\r\nOn the Create Realm screen, give your new realm a name and click Create.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.03.create-realm.png)\r\n\r\nYou may notice the Select Template button which is optional. Currently, there are two template worlds you can use for your own realm: Spellbound Caves and Herobrine's return. You can use one of these templates if you want, but you don't have to. If you don't choose a template, your world will be randomly generated just like it is in a single player game. After your realm is created you'll see the main Realms screen again. This time with your realm in the list.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.06.realms-menu-configure.png)\r\n\r\nYou can click Play right now to jump in the server but we encourage you to check out the Configure button first. You'll see a list of options available for your realm. The most important thing on this screen is the list of invited players. Click the \"+\" button to invite friends to your realm.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.07.configure-screen.png)\r\n\r\nType the player name of a friend you want to invite and click Invite.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.08.invite.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll now be back on the realm configure screen with the newly invited player in the list. Repeat this process for each friend you want to invite. To remove someone from your realm click the little red \"X\" to the right of their name. To make someone an \"Op\" on your realm click the little gray blobby thing to the right of their name.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.09.configure-with-player.png)\r\n\r\nWe also encourage you to check out what's behind the Edit Settings button. Here you can access more options for managing your realm. This is where you can change the name and description of your realm as well as set the difficulty and game mode.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.10.edit-realm.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to play, get back to the main Realms screen and click the Play button.\r\n\r\n### Receiving Invitations\r\n\r\nIf you're on the receiving end of an invitation, you'll first need to go to the main realms screen by clicking on Minecraft Realms from the main menu. If you've been invited to someone's realm you'll see a little animated blocky envelope at the top of the screen. Click the little envelope.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.11.new-invitations.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll now see a Pending Invitation screen. It'll show the name of the realm and the name of the player who invited you. Select the realm and click \"Accept\".\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.12.pending-invitations.png)\r\n\r\nThe name of the realm will go away and... nothing else happens. You need to click the Back button to get back to the main Realms screen. This is the way it supposed to work, apparently.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.13.gotta-click-back.png)\r\n\r\nNow select the realm and click \"Play\".\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.14.play.png)\r\n\r\nOf course, if this is the first time you've played on a realm you'll need to accept the terms of service.\r\n\r\n![](http://mfpimages.s3.amazonaws.com/realms.15.terms-of-service.png)\r\n\r\nThat's it!

  {title: "Playing With Strangers in Minecraft", category_id: 3, description: "Every family is different but we try to give some common sense advise on the subject of playing with strangers on public servers.", body: "This is a tough subject for many parents to deal with. We want to give our kids a fun and safe place to play and often times that means **not** playing with strangers on public servers. The reasons are numerous.\r\n\r\nIf your child doesn't know who they're interacting with, they could be persuaded into revealing personal information about themselves to predators. We're normally not ones for fear mongering but this is a very legitimate concern. Given the huge popularity of Minecraft with kids it's only natural that it will be a place predators are likely to frequent.\r\n\r\nPeople can be rude and use inappropriate language. Even without chatting, there are many ways players can cause grief for other players: destroying creations, inappropriate skins and structures, harassment and other annoying behavior.\r\n\r\nIf a server has a group of regular players they probably have an unspoken set of rules they play by. Newcomers who violate these rules can end up the subject of harsh criticism with little or no explanation. Anonymity brings out the worst in people. All the undesirable behaviors kids exhibit on the playground are magnified online.\r\n\r\nPlaying with people you personally know and trust is always the safest route and it's what we recommend whether you're a kid or an adult. However, at some point your child is going want to venture out into the wild untamed land of public Minecraft servers. If you think your kid is mature enough to handle it, and you're okay with it, here's a few ideas that may help their introduction into the wider internet world go a little smoother.\r\n\r\n1. Talk to you kid about the risks of going online with strangers. People may not be who they say they are in real life. Never give personal information to people you don't know in real life. Be aware of the way people can be critical to newcomers. Tell them people are generally idiots online and they're likely to encounter a few of them. At the same time, emphasize how important it is to treat people politely. Online worlds are very much real places with real person-to-person interactions. Don't do or say anything online you wouldn't do or say in person.\r\n\r\n2. Choose a server that has a pretty good reputation for being kid-friendly to begin with. There are public servers which have strong kid-friendly policies meant to foster a positive and safe environment. Do a Google search for [family-friendly minecraft servers](https://www.google.com/#q=family-friendly+minecraft+servers).\r\n\r\n3. Play *with* them the first few times they go online with strangers. Actually play with them on the same server for a while so you get a feel for the culture and mood of the server as well.\r\n\r\nHere at _Minecraft for Parents_ prefer to play with people we know if real life because we believe life is too short to deal with trolls who just want to spoil other people's fun. But if you or your kid (with your permission) want to venture onto public servers we hope we've provided some useful advice here.", ordinal: 6, slug: "playing-with-strangers-in-minecraft"},
  {title: "What's the Deal with YouTube and Minecraft?", category_id: 4, description: "What percentage of all YouTube videos are Minecraft related? We don't know but we try to explain why their so popular.", body: "The only thing that kids love more than playing Minecraft is watching other people play Minecraft on YouTube. Many parents don't understand why their kid would want to spend so much time watching someone else play a video game. There are actually several reasons why watching Minecraft videos on YouTube is interesting and valuable for kids.\r\n\r\nMinecraft is not like other video games which have tutorials designed to teach you the basic gameplay mechanics in the early levels. Instead, Minecraft drops you into a fully formed world and it's up to you to figure out what to do. YouTube is an invaluable resource for anyone wanting to learn how to do practically _anything_ and _everything_ in Minecraft.\r\n\r\nIf you're playing in Survival mode, video tutorials are almost required viewing if you want to actually survive and build a decent life for yourself in the world (of Minecraft). They can each you which resources to mine, which objects to build and in what order, basic crafting recipes, and other invaluable tips. \r\n\r\nIn Creative mode YouTube videos are just as valuable. Kids learn by watching other people do things. Seeing what other people have built and how they did it gives kids foundational knowledge and inspiration for their own creations. It may spark ideas they wouldn't have had otherwise.\r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting building materials in Minecraft is Redstone which functions as a kind of electricity. Redstone enables some very advanced creations which perform actions. There is no limit to the kinds of things you can build with Redstone. The best way to learn how to use Redstone is to watch videos of other people using it to build various things and explaining how everything works together.\r\n \r\nThere's also the fun-factor of Minecraft videos. YouTube provides the same entertainment value to kids that television provides for adults. Many YouTubers put a lot of effort into producing videos that are fun for kids to watch. Instead of Scooby Doo, our kids watch Minecraft videos on YouTube.", ordinal: 1, slug: "what-s-the-deal-with-youtube-and-minecraft"},

They have people whose job it is to make sure videos are accurately tagged. The trick is to make sure your kid browses YouTube *without* being logged in. YouTube will automatically hide mature videos from anonymous users. The system will never be perfect and your standards may be different from YouTube's standards but having your kids view YouTube without being logged in is a good start.\r\n\r\nWhile it's unreasonable to preview and co-watch every single thing with your kids we do recommend keeping an eye on what they're watching. Pay attention to the the audio of videos within earshot. Pay closer attention when you happen to be passing through the room with the computer. Ask them about what they watch from time to time.\r\n\r\nAs always, you're the parent and your judgment and rules are what count in your household.
