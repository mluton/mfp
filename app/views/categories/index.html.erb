    <p>The purpose of <em>Minecraft for Parents</em> is to provide parents (and kids) with the knowledge to get the most out of Minecraft. We think we've covered all of the important topics but there's still a few articles we're working on and hope to have posted soon. The majority of the information contained on this site is specifically for the computer version of Minecraft. Most instructions are from a Mac OS X point of view since that's what we use here. That shouldn't be a problem since many tasks are the same between OS X and Windows. We hope to have Windows-specific instructions where appropriate in the future.</p>
